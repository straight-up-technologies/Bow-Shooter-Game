## House rules

### How to make changes

### Changes that might not be accepted
We have to be conservative with the core game. This means that some modifications won't be merged, or will have to be evaluated carefully before being merged:

 - Undo/redo features
 - Save/reload features
 - Changes to how the tiles look or their contents
 - Changes to the layout
 - Changes to the grid size

### Changes that are welcome
 - Bug fixes
 - Compatibility improvements
 - "Under the hood" enhancements
 - Small changes that don't have an impact on the core gameplay
